# CV-Webpage
I know, I have one allready, but I must practice HTML and CSS somehow. A CV page is ok, I think.

What do I want? 
I want it green. 
Ok, thats easy. Anything else? 
What about minimalistic...
Everything today is minimalistic, so ok, go on.
...icons on the right
On the right? Not bottom or top?
Right is the new top
It is not.
I will make it be.
...
Icons with links to CVs different sections
Sounds right.
Some sans font. Arial as default. Written in white over green background
Too green
Right. Written in green over light green background
Too green
True. Written in black over very light green background
May work. Go on.
Sections about my character, my interest, my education and my experience
How many sections?
Let me think... 10?
Too many.
4?
Too few.
... 7?
May work. What in the sections?
1. Personal information and contact information
Contact and personal info uses to be at the bottom
Also.
Ok.
2. My interests and passions: games, WH, geek stuff, maths, logic, ...
Ok, but not too long. It is important but not the most important thing
3. What defines me, as logic, comprehensive, helpfull, and handsome
Remove that about handsome
Why would I?
You know why.
Ok... 4. Studies and experience in biology
Studies and experience? They expect to find them in separate sections
Ok... 4. Studies in biology and teaching
Correct. No surprises.
5. Experience as biologist and teacher
Right
6. Experience as programmer
Shouldn´t it be higher in the field?
I can set it as a continuation of passions and hobbies.
That would be nice. We´ll see where to fit it.
7. Pictures
Or we may insert pictures in the previous sections
Thats a better idea. then... 7. More geek stuff
Really?
I want more geek stuff.
Ok. Then we may split the interests and passions into two sections, leaving hobbies as the last section. What about that?
I guess that may work.
Let´s start then.
